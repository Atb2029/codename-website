# Troubleshooting

## My notes are only appearing on the left side of the screen.

Open the strumline options and for the bf strumline set the X ratio to 0.75, and for the dad strumline set the X ratio to 0.25.

## The character editor is buggy.

Please have some patience as we are working on fixing the issues that are causing this.

## Rotating a strum moves the notes.

To prevent this behavior, you can do <syntax lang="haxe">strum.noteAngle = 0;</syntax>
