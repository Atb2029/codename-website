# Cutscenes and dialogues.

### Cutscenes

Making Cutscenes is easy, either drop an .mp4 file in ``./videos`` with the name of the song followed by `-cutscene` at the end, or drop it in the corresponding song folder and simply name it ``cutscene.mp4``

You can also put an ``-end`` before ``-cutscene`` to make that cutscene appear at the end of the song.

### Dialogues
go figure it out i'm too lazy to document everything.
