# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why should I use the engine?

Here are some of the best reasons you should use Codename Engine:
- **Softcoding:** this makes development of mods extremely fast and alot less annoying as there is no time inbetween trying revisions of code.
- **Editors:** powerful editors that make creating charts and characters easier, controls and keybindings are intuitive and allow you to undo your mistakes!
- **Modern:** get all the latest features and capabilites like multiple strumlines, multiple vocals, ndlls, and a extremely capable scripting language.
- **Fast:** this engine is very optimized and is takes very little ram compared to other engines, higher fps!!!

## I'm unsure whether to use this engine or Psych Engine

This heavily depends on your preference, but Psych Engine focuses primarily on scripting songs and has some limitations, and offers a few features which some people might not need, meanwhile it has a strong community full of guides and scripts ready to load which makes modding easier.

In comparison, this engine offers more flexibility and features, such as Custom States and Custom Transitions through scripts, which might provide more options depending on your needs, and the base is mostly clean when you don't take in account the whole modding system (still offers a few changes but not as invasive), but hasn't been expanded enough to make modding easier, so the engine is gonna be really hard for beginners to learn (though this is why this wiki exists).

Theres no need to hardcode in this engine, meanwhile in Psych Engine, to add custom states and other features outside of gameplay you have to edit the source code.

## I'm unsure whether to use this engine or Forever Engine, FPS Plus or Kade Engine

To understand, Forever Engine, FPS Plus and Kade Engine are engines that rely purely on source code, while Codename relies heavily on soft coding. So if you prefer to keep using source code use one of those 3 engines. Forever Engine has a cleaner base and doesn't add too much onto the gameplay, FPS Plus also offers clean source code but also includes fun new additions to the base, and Kade Engine is a more hardcore-rhythm focused engine with a lot of features to enhance gameplay and stuff, also includes a basic LUA system(pretty unoptimized tho)

## I'm unsure whether to use this engine or Yoshi Engine

This engine is the predecessor of Yoshi Engine, which was created by the same person as this engine.
Yoshi Engine is no longer maintained, and has been deprecated, and has been replaced by Codename Engine.
