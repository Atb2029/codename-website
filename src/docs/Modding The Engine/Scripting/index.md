# Scripting

The engine's biggest feature yet, scripting. Currently, you can script in HScript <i>(haxe scripting language)</i>, or in NDLL format <i>(compiled C++ code)</i>, but mainly in HScript, which should make the experience similar to coding in source code.<br>
Scripting can change not only gameplay, but also menus and other engine functions.<br>

We will focus on writting in HScript, so whenever you have to create a script, the filename has to end with an ``.hx``.<br>
<i>(you can also use ``.hscript``, ``.hxc`` and ``.hxs``)</i>

#### Scripting relies heavily on having a console opened at all times.
The console helps you track down errors and bugs with your script. To access it, you can either:
- Press F2 to open a window, or
- Start the game in a cmd or powershell window (or in terminal for linux/mac users)
